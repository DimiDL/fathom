# FathomFox

A suite of tools for developing [Fathom](http://mozilla.github.io/fathom/) rulesets within Firefox:

* Corpus collection and labeling tools (which are likely all you will need)
* An Evaluator which can help you drop into the JS debugger inside your ruleset
* A Vectorizer, which you can ignore. It persists, for now, as an optional manual alternative to simply letting `fathom-train` and `fathom-test` take care of vectorization automatically.

## Page-By-Page Corpus Collection

FathomFox’s primary job is to serialize web pages and let you label elements on them so Fathom can learn.

1. Navigate to a web page that has what you’re trying to recognize: for instance, a background overlay behind a modal dialog, as the provided example ruleset seeks out.
2. Right-click the element, and choose Inspect Element. If the right element eluded your click, fine-tune using Firefox’s developer tools’ Inspector.
3. Switch to the Fathom developer tools tab, enter a label of your choice in the label field, and click Save Page. It “freezes” those pages to your usual downloads folder, inlining images and CSS into data URLs and getting rid of JS to keep pages deterministic so they can be used as a reliable basis for training or testing. (Scripts loading scripts loading other scripts is surprisingly common in the wild, which often makes pages turn out unpredictably, not to mention being dependent on the network.)
4. Label at least 20 pages like this before you attempt any training.

### Tips

* Before freezing pages with the Developer Tools panel, use Firefox’s Responsive Design mode (command-option-M) to set a repeatable 1024x768 window size. The Vectorizer automatically sets this same size by default. This will ensure that the proper CSS and images (which may be driven by media queries) will be frozen (and later reloaded) with the page.
* For maximum fidelity, do your corpus capture in a clean Firefox profile with no other add-ons. Some ad blockers will make changes to the DOM, like adding style attributes to ad iframes to hide them. Visit `about:profiles` to make a fresh profile. (This will automatically happen if you invoke FathomFox from its source checkout using `yarn run browser`.)
* You can press `Ctrl+Shift+O` to save and download a page for pages with hover-to-show elements you want visible upon saving.

See the more detailed treatment of [Fathom training workflow](https://mozilla.github.io/fathom/training.html) in the Fathom manual.

## Bulk Corpus Collector

There is also a bulk Corpus Collector tool, accessible from the toolbar button. Enter some URLs, and it freezes the pages one after another in the same way the dev tools panel does. The Corpus Collector is useful for grabbing hundreds of pages at once, but it doesn’t give you the opportunity to stop and interact with each (though it can scroll to the bottom or wait a predetermined time before freezing). Generally, page-by-page collection is the better choice.

## Evaluator

The Evaluator helps you debug stubborn failures on one to a few pages at a time.

### Get FathomFox Running from a Source Checkout

Note: This is necessary only if you want to use the Evaluator. For simple development and labeling samples, you can more easily install FathomFox through the web at [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fathomfox/).

1. Clone the [Fathom repository](https://github.com/mozilla/fathom/).
2. From within the checkout, inside the `fathom_fox` folder, install dependencies: `yarn run build`.
3. Run a clean copy of Firefox with FathomFox installed: `yarn run browser`.
4. Run `yarn run watch` in a separate terminal. This will keep your running copy of FathomFox up to date as you edit your ruleset.

### Running the Evaluator

Once you have a decent set of coefficients and biases computed, paste them into FathomFox’s `src/rulesets.js`, open some troublesome pages in a Firefox window, and invoke the Evaluator from the toolbar menu. Then, click Evaluate to run the ruleset over the loaded tabs. Any pages with misrecognized nodes will show up in red; click those to see which element was wrongly selected. Unfortunately, you need to manually show the dev tools and switch to the Fathom panel once you get to the page in question; there aren’t yet web extension APIs to do it automatically. Once you do, you’ll see a quick and dirty representation of the “bad” element: a new label called “BAD [the trainee ID]”. Be sure to delete this if you choose to re-save the page for some reason. Also note that the BAD label is created only when the bad cell is clicked, for speed; if you navigate to the bad page manually, the label won’t be there, or there might be an old label from a previous iteration.

The Evaluator is useful for two things:

* Pinpointing which elements are getting misclassified (in case the trainer’s tag excerpts aren’t enough)
* Letting you place debug breakpoints in your rulesets

To do the latter, bring forward the tab of one of your sample pages. Show the dev tools, and navigate to the Debugger panel. In the disclosure tree to the left, disclose FathomFox, and select `rulesets.js`. Scroll to the bottom, past the minified mess, and you’ll see your ruleset code. Place a breakpoint as you like, probably in one of your scoring callbacks. Then go back to the Evaluator tab, and click Evaluate. You’ll end up in the debugger, paused at your breakpoint.

## Vectorizer

Fathom’s commandline tools now take care of vectorization automatically, by running a copy of Firefox and FathomFox in the background. However, if you want to do it manually, you can:

1. Open the Vectorizer from FathomFox’s toolbar button. 
2. Give the Vectorizer a list of your labeled pages’ filenames.
3. Change the Base URL to the address from which you’re serving the pages with `fathom-serve`.
4. Click Vectorize, the pages will flash by, and the vectors will appear in your Downloads folder.

The Retry on Error checkbox should generally stay on, to work around apparently unavoidable spurious errors in the web extension communication APIs. Turn it off only if you’re having inexplicable hangs. It will probably go away altogether someday.

## Thanks

Thanks to Treora for his excellent freeze-dry library!

## Version History

### 3.5

* Record prematurely pruned elements. This bumps the vector version number to 2, which means previous versions of the commandline tools will not understand these new vector files.

### 3.4.1

* Have the Evaluator skip over `about:` tabs that used to crash it with permission problems.

### 3.4

* When the Retry checkbox is checked in the Vectorizer, it now retries only errors it thinks are transient. This means you don’t have to wait 200 seconds for your syntax errors to bubble to the fore if you forget to uncheck Retry.
* Make `vectorType` optional if it’s the same as the trainee ID.

### 3.3

* The Vectorizer now operates in parallel, resulting in large speed gains.
* Merge fathom-trainees info FathomFox. This makes fewer repos to clone, fewer addons to install, and fewer build processes to babysit for ruleset authors. It also means a simpler FathomFox with less message passing.
* The Vectorizer now shows an error message when a scoring callback returns undefined. This helps catch certain common mistakes:
  * A name mismatch between the `name` value passed into a rule and the name of the rule in the list of `[ruleName, coefficient]` pairs referenced in the ruleset
  * A scoring callback failing to return a number
  * Corner cases in DOM or CSSOM routines, e.g. `innerText` returning `null` instead of the empty string in Firefox
* Add `isTarget` hook to trainees to customize what the Vectorizer considers a target.
* Automatically add a slash to the end of the Vectorizer base URL if there isn’t one.

### 3.2

* Freezing pages now takes only 1/7 as long, thanks to an upgrade to the freeze-dry library.
* There’s now a keyboard shortcut for freezing the current page: command-shift-O. This lets you capture hover states.
* The original URL of each frozen page is now preserved in an HTML attribute.
* Rather than always defaulting to 1024x768 for the Viewport Size in the Vectorizer, pull the default from the `viewportSize` of the selected trainee.
* Remove obsolete Trainer, pieces of which now remain solely as an Evaluator, for debugging rulesets.

### 3.1

* Add an Evaluate button to the Trainer, useful for ruleset debugging.
* Add a Base URL field to the Vectorizer, which saves a lot of find-and-replacing on page filenames.
* Add a Retry On Error checkbox to the Vectorizer so retrying can be disabled during ruleset debugging.
* Document Vectorizer.

### 3.0

* Switch to Fathom 3. This requires a fathom-trainees fork based on tag 3.0 or later. Equivalently, you can make these changes:
  * Switch to specifying coefficients as a Map instead of an Array. If you don’t want to name your rules, Fathom will auto-name them `_0`, `_1`, etc., in order of appearance in the ruleset.
  * The `rulesetMaker` function no longer takes any params. In Fathom 3, all weighting is done internal to the framework.
  * All rules should return a value between 0 and 1, representing a confidence.
* Add the Vectorizer tool, which exports feature vectors for optimization with Fathom 3’s commandline tool.
* Fix additional causes of duplicate downloads when using the Corpus Collector on recent versions of Firefox. I think they’re really all gone now.

### 2.3.1

* Fix Corpus Collector spewing extra bullet points, closing the wrong tabs, downloading duplicates, and generally misbehaving in recent Firefox versions (e.g. 65).

### 2.3

* Clicking a good/bad cell now takes you to that sample’s tab and, in the case of a bad cell, indicates which element was wrongly selected, which is invaluable for debugging. Identifying the element requires a fathom-trainees fork that pulls in Fathom 2.8. If you have a custom success function, you must also add a third param to it and scribble a ``badElement`` property on the received object.
* Add a Pause button to the Trainer. This is useful while on battery power or to take the load off Firefox’s JS thread so the dev tools can run quickly.

### 2.2

* Make viewport size customizable during capture.
* Bump default freeze delay from 0 to 1. This avoids many dead-object errors during bulk capture.
* Limit length of tags in devtools panel so they don’t make it unusably wide.
* Focus the new label field after inspecting an element and switching to the Fathom devtools panel. This makes for faster entry.

### 2.1

* Add computation of a 95% confidence interval for accuracy, using binomial proportion confidence intervals.

### 2.0

* Support customizable viewport sizes in Trainer.
* Stop using `traineeCoeffs` message in favor of `trainee`, which is more future-proof. This requires a fathom-trainees fork based on d93bc593a08f6503d137df4d35ce2a2bc6b93b6e or later.

### 1.3

* Re-saving frozen pages should now be idempotent most of the time. (glob)
* Solve some causes of Corpus Collector freezing. (glob)
* Add progress reporting during freezing. (glob)
* Use the hostname as a download filename in the absence of a user-provided one. (glob)
* Use standard Photon menus for the toolbar button (since the stylesheets have now been documented). (glob)

### 1.2.2

* Fix bug where some inspected elements would yield merely “false” in the Fathom dev panel.

### 1.2.1

* Fix a packaging problem that was causing the dev panel not to work, due to a missing copy of the Simmer library.

### 1.2

* Add a decent UI to the devtools panel. Now you can see what you’ve labeled! (glob)

### 1.1.1

* Fix a bug where the Save button on the devtools panel wouldn’t do anything unless an element was inspected.

### 1.1

* Add Trainer.
* Switch from npm to yarn.

### 1.0.1

* Fix the “No matching message handler” errors when downloading using the Corpus Collector.
* Switch from webpack to rollup.
